        These scan statistics are for a scan of {{ num_seqs }} sequences from {{ dataset_name }}
        averaging {{ '%.1f' % (num_bases / num_seqs) }} base pairs in length. There are
        {{ num_sites }} predicted sites for {{ num_motifs }} motifs averaging 1 binding site every
        {{ '%d' % (num_bases / num_sites) }} base pairs.
        <p>
        Each binding site has a Z-score associated with it.
        The Z-score is an estimate of how confidently STEME predicts this site
        is a binding site.  A Z-score of 1 means STEME is sure that the site is
        a binding site.
        A Z-score of 0.5 means STEME thinks the site is equally likely to be a binding site
        or background genomic sequence.
        The Z-score is calculated from how well the site
        matches the motif and how well it fits STEME's background model.

        The number of sites for each motif. The number of sites above the Z-score threshold
        is shown. Also shown is the fraction of the number of sites that is the sum of
        the Z-scores for all the sites. This is the expectation of the
        number of sites under STEME's model.

        The Z-scores for the predicted sites segregated by motif.
        The sites are sorted by Z-score.
        This plot allows us to compare how strong each motif's predicted binding sites are.
        Vaguer motifs with lower information
        contents tend to have difficulty achieving high Z-scores. In these cases a perfect match
        may not produce a high Z-score.

        The positions of the predicted sites in the sequences. Each marker represents a site.
        The y-axis represents how close the site is to the start or end of the sequence it
        is in. The sites are sorted in the x-axis according to their y-value. This plot allows
        us to see if particular motifs have sites that cluster in the centre or beginning
        or end of the sequences. For example, suppose a motif's scatter plot has a flat region
        in the centre. This would allow us to see that this motif's sites have a bias towards
        the centre of the sequences. A scatter plot for uniformly distributed sites would have
        a near constant gradient.

        The sequence coverage by motif: how many sequences have at least one site at any given
        Z-score.

        The first plot shows the strength of the best hit for each motif (y-axis) in
        each sequence (x-axis). The motifs are hierarchically clustered on the basis
        of which sequences they have strong hits in.
        The second plot shows a statistic measuring the co-occurrence of a pair of motifs
        across the sequences.
        The motifs are again ordered according to a hierarchical clustering (not shown).
