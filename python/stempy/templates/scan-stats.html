        These scan statistics are for a scan of {{ num_seqs }} sequences from {{ dataset_name }}
        averaging {{ '%.1f' % (num_bases / num_seqs) }} base pairs in length. There are
        {{ num_sites }} predicted sites for {{ num_motifs }} motifs averaging 1 binding site every
        {{ '%d' % (num_bases / num_sites) }} base pairs.

        The Z-scores for the predicted sites segregated by motif.
        The sites are sorted by Z-score. The
        Z-score is an estimate of how confidently STEME predicts this site is a binding site.
        A Z-score of 1 would mean STEME is sure that the site is a binding site.
        The Z-score is calculated from how well the
        site matches the motif and how well it fits STEME's background model.
        The plot allows us to compare how strong each motif's predicted binding sites are.
        Vaguer motifs with lower information
        contents tend to have difficulty achieving high Z-scores. In these cases a perfect match
        may not produce a high Z-score.

        The positions of the predicted sites in the sequences. Each marker represents a site. The y-axis represents how
        close the site is to the start or end of the sequence it is in. The sites are sorted in the x-axis according to 
        their y-value. This plot allows us to see if particular motifs have sites that cluster in the centre or beginning
        or end of the sequences. For example, suppose a motif's scatter plot has a flat region in the centre. This would allow us
        to see that this motif's sites have a bias towards the centre of the sequences. A scatter plot for uniformly
        distributed sites would have a near constant gradient.

        The sequence coverage: how many sequences have sites for each motif as a function
        of Z-score threshold.

        This plot shows the density of predicted sites for each sequence. Each sequence is
        represented as one x-value. The sequences are presented in the same order that they
        are in the original STEME FASTA input file. Each marker represents the density of
        sites for a particular motif in that sequence. The density of sites is the number
        of predicted sites per base pair in the sequence. This plot allows us to see if there
        are certain sequences which have a concentration of a particular motif's sites. We use
        the density of sites rather than a count to give a fair comparison between sequences
        of different lengths.
        <img src="scan-lengths.png" alt="Scan sequence lengths image is missing!"/>
        <br>
        This plot shows the sequence lengths. The lengths are scatter plotted in the
        same order as in the plot above (and in the original input FASTA file), they are
        also line plotted in green in order of size.

        The first plot shows the strength of the best hit for each motif (y-axis) in
        each sequence (x-axis). The motifs are hierarchically clustered on the basis
        of which sequences they have strong hits in.
        The second plot shows a statistic measuring the co-occurrence of a pair of motifs
        across the sequences.
        The motifs are again ordered according to a hierarchical clustering (not shown).
