Accurate efficient motif finding in large data sets
---------------------------------------------------

STEME started life as an approximation to the Expectation-Maximisation algorithm for 
the type of model used in motif finders such as MEME. STEMEâ€™s EM approximation 
runs an order of magnitude more quickly than the MEME implementation for typical 
parameter settings. STEME has now developed into a fully-fledged motif finder in 
its own right.
